# 💻 Laptop Price Prediction 🎯

A Machine Learning project to predict laptop prices based on technical specifications — built as an end-to-end pipeline and deployed using **Streamlit Cloud**. 🚀

## 🔍 Features
- 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- 🧠 Model Training & Comparison (Multiple Regressors)
- 🧪 Cross-Validation & Hyperparameter Tuning
- 🌐 Streamlit-based Web App Deployment

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (Pipeline, Regressors, Preprocessing)
- Streamlit (Deployment)
- Jupyter Notebook
